# libraryProject
Javascript project to input book date.

Create a library that is housed in a simple array in js.
Have a button that onClick will provide a form to complete with Title, Author, pages, and read.
Submission of this form will add the book to Library.
Show added book on the page via a table or cards.
Provide a button with each listing to remove the book from the library.
(Possibly add a button to toggle whether the book has been read.)

Add Book:
onClick - pop up to complete book info
onSubmit - Add book object to array
addCard to library that displays book info
-Green card is book that has been read
-Red card is unread book
-yellow card is currently being read

Each card has a button to "remove from library":
onClick - delete object from array and card from page
